# Sample Jetpack Compose App

## What is this about?
This repository is made to track my progress in learning Jetpack Compose.

## What I will make?
I will make (possibly replicate some ideas I found on the internet) a simple habit tracking app, to ensure that
I am able to apply the concepts I am learning. 

## Stacks I will use
| Stack | Tools |
|------|------|
| Frontend | Jetpack Compose |
| Programming Language | Kotlin |
| Database | Appwrite |
| Backend | Appwrite |
| Version Control | Git and Github |
| IDE | Android Studio |


## What to expect?
Since this is a simple project, it will not be too complex. Feel free to comment out improvements and bugs that
you may find. Criticisms and suggestions are welcomed :).
